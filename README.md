# Information Retrieval Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects related to Information Retrieval (IR), implemented using Python. Each project focuses on different aspects of IR, ranging from building basic search systems to incorporating advanced techniques like spelling correction, document ranking, and machine learning for text classification.

Furthermore, you can explore other related Information Retrieval projects I've worked on, specifically focusing on BERT transformer models, at: [Bert-Information-Retrieval](https://github.com/proshir/Bert-Information-Retrieval).

## Project List:

1. **Basic IR System with Boolean and Proximity Queries**: Implements an IR system supporting Boolean and proximity queries, with preprocessing, indexing, and query processing functionalities.

2. **Spelling Correction and Wildcard Queries**: Enhances the IR system by adding spelling correction and wildcard query support, leveraging techniques like Levenshtein distance and Permuterm indexing.

3. **BSBI Algorithm for Inverted Indexing**: Implements the Block-Sorted Based Indexing algorithm for building inverted indexes, with a focus on efficient storage using gamma coding.

4. **Document Ranking Strategies**: Implements three different document ranking approaches (vector space model, binary independence model, and language model) and compares their performance using evaluation metrics.

5. **Text Classification with Naive Bayes, Word Embeddings, LSA, and SVM**: Utilizes machine learning techniques for text classification within the domain of IR, including Naive Bayes, word embeddings, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers.

Each project includes comprehensive documentation, code implementations, and reports summarizing key findings, challenges faced, and enhancements made during development.

Feel free to explore each project for detailed insights into different aspects of Information Retrieval!
