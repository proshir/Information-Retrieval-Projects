In this analysis, the application of stemming is explored through a comparison of text passages before and after stemming.

Through this investigation, the significance of stemming in optimizing text normalization techniques is underscored, highlighting its utility in enhancing the accuracy and robustness of natural language processing applications.\n"

    "### Analyzing Word Frequency Distributions in Positive and Negative Reviews\r\n",
    "In this analysis, we compute frequency distributions of words in both positive and negative reviews to identify the 30 most common words in each sentiment category. By examining the prevalence of words across positive and negative sentiment classes, we aim to discern distinct language patterns associated with each sentiment. Notably, we observe that common words such as \"film\" and \"movie\" exhibit high frequencies in both positive and negative reviews, suggesting their widespread usage across sentiment categories. This exploration provides valuable insights into the prominent themes and language features characterizing positive and negative sentiments in the dataset, facilitating a deeper understanding of textual dynamics for sentiment analysis tasks."

    "## Utilizing Custom Naive Bayes Classifier\n",
    "In this step, we employ our custom Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis. This classifier utilizes logarithmic operations to handle division and multiplication, ensuring numerical stability. Additionally, we incorporate Laplace smoothing by adding a pseudocount of 1 to prevent division by zero and enhance the model's robustness. During the fitting process, the classifier calculates label probabilities and word probabilities based on the training data, facilitating sentiment prediction. Subsequently, when making predictions on the test dataset, the model computes label scores for each document and selects the label with the highest score as the predicted sentiment. Through these mechanisms, our custom Naive Bayes classifier effectively learns from the training data and provides accurate sentiment predictions on unseen documents.r"

    "FastText is an extension of the Word2Vec model that takes into account subword information by breaking words into smaller character n-grams. In FastText, unlike Word2Vec, the model utilizes the get_sentence_vector function to obtain the vector representation of a sentence directly. This approach allows FastText to capture the meaning of out-of-vocabulary words by aggregating the vectors of their constituent character n-grams, making it particularly effective for handling misspellings, morphological variations, and rare words."

    "In this analysis, we compare the performance metrics of different classification techniques, including Naive Bayes, Word2Vec, FastText, and LSA_SVM. Each technique's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were evaluated on the test dataset. Among the techniques, Word2Vec demonstrated the highest accuracy of 0.859560, followed closely by LSA_SVM with an accuracy of 0.858760. This comparison sheds light on the effectiveness of various classification approaches in accurately predicting the sentiment of textual data."
